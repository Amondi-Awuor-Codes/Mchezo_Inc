        question: "A witness saw a matatu near where Akinyi vanished. They couldn't remember the color. So what did YOU prioritize, detective? What mattered more to you in that moment?",
        answers: [
            "I pushed for the color! Every detail matters, you know that!",
            "I asked about the vehicle type. Colors fade, models don't.",
            "I focused on time and place. Context first—that's proper procedure.",
            "I got their contact and moved on. I had other leads to chase!"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2
    },
    {
        question: "Evidence surfaced that contradicted your theory about Akinyi. We know you saw it. So what did you do? Did you bury it, or did you actually do your job?",
        answers: [
            "I... I set it aside. My theory was solid. It had to be right.",
            "I stopped everything. Went back to square one. The truth matters more than my ego.",
            "I looked for more evidence to confirm what I already knew. That's not bias—that's thoroughness!",
            "I noted it down, okay? But I couldn't just abandon weeks of work."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1
    },
    {
        question: "Your superior ordered you to drop a lead. A vital one. You knew it mattered. So tell me—did you follow orders like a good soldier, or did you actually fight for Akinyi?",
        answers: [
            "I followed orders. Chain of command exists for a reason.",
            "I kept digging on my own time. Off the books. Someone had to.",
            "I fought back! I demanded they let me continue. Akinyi deserved that much.",
            "I trusted my superior. They see the bigger picture... don't they?"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1
    },
    {
        question: "You were 80% sure. Eighty percent. Your partner begged for more evidence. But you were impatient, weren't you? What did you choose—patience or recklessness?",
        answers: [
            "I made the arrest. 80% is good enough when a girl is missing!",
            "I waited. I gathered more. I wasn't going to ruin an innocent person's life.",
            "I confronted him directly. Looked him in the eyes. You can tell a lot from a man's reaction.",
            "My gut has never failed me. I went with instinct."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1
    },
    {
        question: "Dandora. You remember, don't you? The evidence or the witness—you could only save one. You chose the evidence. The witness died screaming. So tell me, detective... was it worth it?",
        answers: [
            "Yes. Evidence convicts. Evidence saves future victims. I'd do it again.",
            "No... God, no. I should have saved her. I replay it every night.",
            "It depends. Did the evidence lead to justice? Then maybe... maybe it was worth it.",
            "I... choose not to answer."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3
    }
