                A witness saw a matatu near where Akinyi vanished. They couldn't remember the color. So what did YOU prioritize, detective? What mattered more to you in that moment?

                Evidence surfaced that contradicted your theory about Akinyi. We know you saw it. So what did you do? Did you bury it, or did you actually do your job?
