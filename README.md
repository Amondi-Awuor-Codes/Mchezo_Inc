I transformed a standard quiz app into a fully immersive detective experience, weaving the quiz into a rich narrative with storyline, audio, videos, and multiple themed rooms.
Each room presents unique challenges:
a Memory Room for card matching,
a Quiz Room for answering questions,
and an Escape Room for solving puzzles.
Users navigate these interactive challenges while the app tracks scores, provides hints, and offers lifelines, making the learning experience both fun and rewarding.

Technically, I built the app using Java for logic, HTML and CSS for layout and styling, and a backend to manage progression and scoring.
This approach is not just a quiz—it’s an engaging, educational, and interactive story that combines problem-solving with immersive storytelling,
showing how creativity and technology can elevate traditional learning tools.
